# Project Title: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service


## 1.1 Introduction
In this project, the customer segmentation for a subscription service is analysed. However, before the analysis, the customer segmentation dataset was subjected to data cleaning and preparation to ensure no missing or incorrect values in critical columns like subscription type and dates, revenue, and canceled. Also, the data type is checked to ensure they are correctly formatted before further analysis. Importantly, duplicate values were removed from the dataset while in the Excel environment to have unique entries.
After this exploration, the customer segmentation data was analysed using three major analysis tools: Excel, SQL, and Power BI, which is used to create a dashboard that presents the outcomes of the analysis. The skills showcased in this project are duplicate handling, summarising using pivot tables, chart building, data querying, and presentation.  
The report is presented in two main parts. The first part presents the outcomes of the data analysis using Microsoft Excel, and the second part presents the data analysis done using SQL. Attached to this report is a dashboard created by Power BI.


## 1.2 Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends.

## 1.3 The Report 
In this section, the results of the analysis of the sales performance of a Retail store are presented. The analysis was done using Microsoft Excel and SQL, and Power BI, was used to produce an interactive dashboard that highlights the findings of the analysis. 

  ### 1.3.1 Microsoft Excel: Part One
In this section, pivot tables were used to summarize total sales by product, region, month and other interesting reports were also created. Additionally, Excel formulas were used to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region, and other interesting key insights are also presented.

  #### A. Revenue Distribution by Region
Here, the focus of the analysis is on comparing revenue contributions and identifying trends. The report provides a detailed analysis of the revenue generated by four geographical regions: East, South, West, and North, showing the revenue contribution from each region and highlighting the overall performance based on the total revenue of 67,540,175.00.
