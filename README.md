# Project Two

## Project Title: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service


### Introduction
In this project, the customer segmentation for a subscription service is analysed. However, before the analysis, the customer segmentation dataset was subjected to data cleaning and preparation to ensure no missing or incorrect values in critical columns like subscription type and dates, revenue, and canceled. 


### Objectives
The goal of this analysis is to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends.

### Data Sources
The primary data source used in the analysis is Salesdata.xls titled LITA Capstone Sales Data, which was provided by the Incubator for assessment in the LITA training I underwent. 

### Tools Used
The customer segmentation data was analysed using three major analysis tools which are:
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here] (https://www.microsoft.com)
   1. For Data Cleaning
   2. For Analysis
- SQL (Structured Query Language) was used to write queries that further extract insights from the customer segmentation for subscription service data; and
- Power BI
   1. Is used to create an interesting story-telling dashboard that presents the outcomes of the analysis. 


### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of cleaning and preparation of the data, the following steps are taken after the loading of the data:
- The data type is checked to ensure they are correctly formatted. 
- Missing values or variables are checked to detect their presence in the data.
- Duplicate values were checked and removed from the data while in the Excel environment to obtain unique entries in the dataset to attain the right information from the provided data.


The skills showcased in this project are duplicate handling, summarising using pivot tables, chart building, data querying, and presentation.  
The report is presented in two main parts. The first part presents the outcomes of the data analysis using Microsoft Excel, and the second part presents the data analysis done using SQL. Attached to this report is a dashboard created by Power BI.


## The Report 
In this section, the results of the analysis of the sales performance of a Retail store are presented. The analysis was done using Microsoft Excel and SQL, and Power BI, was used to produce an interactive dashboard that highlights the findings of the analysis. 

### Part One: Analysing Using Microsoft Excel Tool
In this section, pivot tables were used to summarize total sales by product, region, month and other interesting reports were also created. Additionally, Excel formulas were used to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region, and other interesting key insights are also presented.

  #### A. Revenue Distribution by Region
Here, the focus of the analysis is on comparing revenue contributions and identifying trends. The report provides a detailed analysis of the revenue generated by four geographical regions: East, South, West, and North, showing the revenue contribution from each region and highlighting the overall performance based on the total revenue of 67,540,175.00.
