# **Project Two**

## **Project Title: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service**

### **Introduction**
---
In this project, the customer segmentation for a subscription service is analysed. However, before the analysis, the customer segmentation dataset was subjected to data cleaning and preparation to ensure no missing or incorrect values in critical columns like subscription type and dates, revenue, and canceled. 


### **Objectives**
---
The goal of this analysis is to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends.

### **Data Sources**
---
The main data source for this analysis is customerdata.xls, titled LITA Capstone Sales Data, provided by the Incubator as part of the assessment for the LITA training program I completed.


### **Tools Used**
---
The customer segmentation data was analysed using three major analysis tools which are:
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here] (https://www.microsoft.com)
   1. For Data Cleaning
   2. For Analysis
- SQL (Structured Query Language) was used to write queries that further extract insights from the customer segmentation for subscription service data; and
- Power BI
   1. Is used to create an interesting story-telling dashboard that presents the outcomes of the analysis. 


### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
---
In the initial phase of cleaning and preparation of the data, the following steps are taken after the loading of the data:
- The data type is checked to ensure they are correctly formatted. 
- Missing values or variables are checked to detect their presence in the data.
- Duplicate values were checked and removed from the data while in the Excel environment to obtain unique entries in the dataset to attain the right information from the provided data.


### **Exploratory Data Analysis**
---
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach for analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual techniques. This process typically involves using summary statistics (such as mean, median, and standard deviation) and visualizations (like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots) to thoroughly examine the data. In this project, pivot table summaries are used to identify data types, missing values, outliers, and errors. This approach also provides insights into customer segmentation and behaviour, helping uncover key patterns in subscription service usage.
hence, the following questions are answered about the data:
- What are the subscription patterns of customers based on region, month, and year?
- What is the average subscription duration?
- Which are the most popular subscription types?
- How many customers are there from each region?
- What is the most popular subscription type by the number of customers?
- Which customers canceled their subscriptions within 6 months?
- What is the average subscription duration for all customers?
- Who are the customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months?
- What is the total revenue generated by each subscription type?
- Which are the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations?
- What is the total number of active and canceled subscriptions?

### **Findings of the Analysis** ###
---
Here the results of the analysis of the customer data are presented. The following results are obtained:


#### **A. Revenue Distribution by Region** ####
---
##### *Key Observations* #####
- East: This region leads the group with the highest revenue of 16,958,763.00, representing 25.12% of the total revenue. The East’s strong performance suggests it is a major contributor to overall sales.
- South: Coming in a close second, the South region contributed 16,899,064.00, accounting for 25.02% of the total revenue. The South’s performance is nearly identical to the East, indicating a highly competitive revenue contribution.
- West: The West generated 16,864,376.00, representing 24.98% of total revenue. Although slightly behind the South and East regions, it is still a solid performer.
- North: The North region contributed 16,817,972.00, accounting for 24.88% of the total revenue. While it ranks last among the regions, the North still demonstrates considerable strength in its revenue generation.



#### **B. Revenue by Region and Subscription Type** ####
---
##### *Key insights reveal regional subscription preferences:* ##### 
- The East and North favour Basic subscriptions, suggesting price sensitivity or preference for entry-level services. 
- In the South, Premium subscriptions dominate, likely due to a higher demand for advanced features, boosting revenue per customer.
- The West region prefers Standard subscriptions, indicating a balance between price and features.
- Overall, revenue distribution is balanced across all regions, with only a small variance of 140,791.00 between the highest (East) and lowest (North). 
This result suggests that while preferences vary, the company’s subscription options effectively capture value in each region.



#### **C. Report on Revenue by Subscription Type** ####
---
##### *Key Observations* #####
- Basic Subscription: The Basic subscription is the highest-grossing type, generating 33,776,735.00, which is nearly 50% of the total revenue. This indicates that the Basic tier is highly popular among customers. This suggests that the Basic tier is the most popular and likely attracts the largest portion of the customer base, possibly due to its affordability or simplicity.
- Premium Subscription: The Premium subscription brought in 16,899,064.00, accounting for approximately 25% of the total revenue. This suggests that a significant portion of customers are willing to pay for higher-tier services.
- Standard Subscription: The Standard subscription generated 16,864,376.00, contributing roughly 25% of the total revenue. The Standard tier is closely comparable to the Premium tier in terms of revenue generated.
- This close competition between these tiers shows that both mid-level and high-level subscriptions appeal to a similar number of customers.
- There are diverse customer preferences. The fact that both Premium and Standard subscription types each account for a quarter of the total revenue shows that there is a sizable segment of customers interested in more advanced or enhanced service options. While Basic is dominant, the presence of strong Premium and Standard subscription revenues suggests a good balance of customers across all tiers.




#### **D. Report on Cancellation Rates by Subscription Type**
---
##### *Key insights reveal trends in subscription retention and cancellations:* #####
- Strong Retention in Basic Tier**: The Basic subscription retains nearly 70% of its revenue from active subscriptions, suggesting that customers find it valuable and affordable enough to maintain.
- High Cancellations in Premium and Standard: Both Premium and Standard subscriptions face high cancellation rates, with over half of their revenue coming from canceled subscriptions. This indicates that customers may not perceive enough value to justify the cost or may be influenced by pricing and service quality.
- Premium vs. Standard Churn: Premium and Standard subscriptions both show about 60% cancellations, with Premium showing slightly more canceled revenue. This suggests a greater churn risk for higher-priced subscriptions.




#### **E. Report on Customer Count by Subscription Type** ####
---
##### *Key insights reveal trends in subscription popularity and upsell potential:* #####
- Basic Subscription: The Basic subscription type has the highest customer count, with 16,921 customers. This represents 50% of the total customer base, suggesting it is the most popular, representing 50% of the customer base and generating the highest revenue. This likely reflects its affordability and appeal as a simpler service option.
- Premium Subscription: The Premium subscription type has 8,446 customers, making up approximately 25% of the total customer base.
- Standard Subscription: The Standard subscription type has 8,420 customers, also accounting for approximately 25% of the total customer base, very close to the Premium subscription.
- There is a balanced appeal of Premium and Standard subscriptions each making up about 25% of the customer base, indicating that both plans attract distinct segments. However, customer count does not directly correlate with revenue.




#### **F. Report on Customer Distribution by Region** ####
---
##### *Key Observations* #####
The customer base is evenly distributed across regions, each contributing roughly 25% to the total:
- East Region: Leads with 8,488 customers, slightly ahead of others, indicating a marginally stronger market presence.
- South Region: Close behind with 8,446 customers.
- North Region: Has 8,433 customers, nearly matching the South.
- West Region: Slightly smaller at 8,420 customers, yet very close to other regions.
##### *Insights:* #####
- Even Customer Distribution: Each region has a similar customer count, with the East-leading by only 68 customers over the West, indicating balanced geographic reach.
- Broad Market Appeal: The nearly equal distribution suggests the subscription service appeals broadly across all regions.




#### **G. Report on Revenue Distribution by Year and Subscription Type** ####
---
##### *Key Findings of Revenue Trends* #####
- 2022 saw the highest revenue, with a total of 40.5 million generated, split between active and canceled subscriptions across Basic, Premium, and Standard plans.
- In 2023, revenue dropped to 27 million, representing a decrease in total revenue. This drop could suggest factors such as a rise in cancellations, fewer new customers, or lower subscription fees.
##### *Insights on Subscription Type and Status* #####
- Basic Plan Dominance: The Basic subscription plan consistently generates the highest revenue, contributing over 16.9 million in 2022 and 13.4 million in 2023, even across both active and canceled subscriptions.
- Premium Plan Performance: The Premium plan saw strong performance in 2022, with 10.1 million in revenue coming from cancelled subscriptions alone, suggesting those who subscribed for this plan cancelled their subscription at the end of the year. Therefore, there is a noticeable decrease in revenue generated in 2023, with Premium generating 6.7 million from active customers.
- Standard Plan: The Standard plan contributes the least to total revenue, but its revenue remains stable. In 2022, it generated 10 million total (both active and canceled), and in 2023, around 13.5 million.
Revenue from Active vs. Canceled Subscriptions
- In 2022, a significant portion of the revenue came from canceled subscriptions (around 16.8 million, a combination of Premium, Basic, and Standard).
- In 2023, the revenue from active subscriptions is almost equal to that from canceled subscriptions, with each group contributing around 13.5 million.



#### **H. Findings on Regional Revenue and Cancellations** ####
---
##### *Key Findings* #####
- Revenue from canceling vs. retaining customers is similarly split across regions, except the East, where all customers have retained their subscriptions.
- South: 10.03% of total revenue from retained customers (3,382) and 14.99% from canceled customers (5,064).
- West: 10.00% from retained (3,376) and 14.97% from canceled customers (5,044).
- North: 9.96% from retained (3,366) and 14.94% from canceled customers (5,067).
Thus, the results obtained implied that cancellations in South, West, and North regions significantly impact revenue sustainability, indicating a need to understand and address drivers behind customer cancellations for long-term stability.



##### **I. Report on Active vs. Canceled Subscriptions by Plan** ####
---
##### *Key Findings: Active vs. Canceled Subscriptions by Plan* ####

- ##### *Basic Subscription Plan* #####
  - Active vs. Canceled:
    - Active subscriptions generated $23.7 million, representing 70% of the plan’s total revenue.
    - Canceled subscriptions contributed $10 million, accounting for the remaining 30%.
  - **Insight**: The Basic plan demonstrates strong retention, with most revenue from active subscribers. However, the 30% cancellation rate suggests room for improvement in retaining long-term customers.

- ##### *Premium Subscription Plan* #####
  - Active vs. Canceled:
    - Active subscriptions contributed $6.7 million (40% of revenue).
    - Canceled subscriptions accounted for $10.1 million (60% of revenue).
  - **Insight**: With 60% of revenue from canceled subscriptions, the Premium plan shows higher churn. This may indicate that customers find limited long-term value in the higher-tier offering.

- ##### *Standard Subscription Plan* #####
  - Active vs. Canceled:
    - Active subscriptions contributed $6.75 million (40% of revenue).
    - Canceled subscriptions totalled $10.1 million (60% of revenue).
  - Insight: Similar to the Premium plan, the Standard plan has a high cancellation rate, suggesting customers may not find sufficient ongoing value in this tier.

##### **Overall Performance of All Plans** #####
---
- Active Revenue: $37.2 million (55% of total revenue).
- Canceled Revenue: $30.3 million (45% of total revenue).

##### *Key Insights Across All Plans* #####
1. Higher Retention in Basic Plan: The Basic plan leads in retention, with 70% of its revenue from active subscribers, indicating stronger customer loyalty.
2. High Cancellation Rates in Premium and Standard: Both plans show high cancellation rates, with 60% of their revenue from canceled subscribers, suggesting that customers may not perceive enough value to justify continued subscriptions.


#### **Customer Count Analysis by Year** ####
---
##### *Key Findings:* #####
- In 2022, the subscription service attracted 20,275 customers, accounting for about 60% of the total customer base.
- In 2023, the customer count decreased to 13,512 (around 40% of total customers).
This drop in new or retained customers suggests a decrease in growth rate or increased churn in 2023. It highlights a need to investigate potential causes for the decline, such as market saturation, customer dissatisfaction, increased competition, or economic factors.
